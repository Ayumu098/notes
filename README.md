# Notes

This is a repository of notes, made in Obsidian, for various technical topics.

## Formatting

### Obsidian Markdown

While most files are in general markdown format, some components are currently for Obsidian only (such as stylized block quotes and YAML headers). This repository will always be made with Obsidian first in-mind.

### Guidelines

Make notes as atomic or modular as possible. Keep a third person perspective. Use references for each note (file) to your discretion, but follow the IEEE format citation guideline.

## Collaboration

### Issues

For any issues such as typos, incorrectly referenced citations, misquotations, false information, or anything notably problematic, kindly raise an issue.

### Pull Requests

This repository accepts pull requests.  Just make sure to follow the guidelines and use appropriate references.
